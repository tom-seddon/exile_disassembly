* Exile disassembly

Buildable copy of Exile.

Based on the disassembly here: http://www.level7.org.uk/miscellany/exile-disassembly.txt

Use BeebAsm to build it. Unfortunately Exile isn't really constructed
in a BeebAsm-friendly way, so the build process is a bit Heath
Robinson. But, if you manage to make it work, you should be rewarded
with two files matching the originals:

=$.EXILEB= SHA1: ede3f7bbe3bf6b001776ab53fbd7f8488c7489f1

=$.EXILEMC= SHA1: 7768adb6154f064a0ee413dab92c63c31236fae7

* To build

With BeebAsm on OS X, just type =make=...

The output will appear in a folder called =./tmp= in your working
copy.

Haven't tried Linux or Windows but it shouldn't be too much effort to
get it working...

* Disassembly notes

- A few equb values had to change here and there compared to the
  disassembly, because they weren't the same as the files on the STH
  disc

- I made a stab, hopefully not too incorrectly, at deriving a few
  constants

- There's a lump of data in =exilemc_data.dat= that doesn't seem to
  have any obvious purpose - it doesn't look like code and nothing
  seems to use it

- The source file was autogenerated, and as well as making a general
  mess of the layout the process also put some comment blocks in the
  wrong places. Maybe one day I'll go through and put them back where
  they should be.
